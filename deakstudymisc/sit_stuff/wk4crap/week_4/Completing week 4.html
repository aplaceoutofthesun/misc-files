<h1>Completing week 4</h1>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Congratulations you have reached the end of week four.</p>
<p>We have explored the various applications of probability distributions and data transformation. You have also practically applied these concepts through programming tasks in R and RStudio. Now that you have had experience in performing these programming functions and you have developed an understanding of the concepts underpinning them.</p>
<p>In summary, you have learned about data distributions, as well as different operations you can apply to data to make them more suitable for different purposes. One of these purposes is data modelling and building predictive models. This is what we will learn over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>To help you consolidate your learning this week, reflect on the information that was new to you. Spend some time revising the last two weeks content. Practise the programming functions that were introduced to you.</p>
<p>As an extension task, find some other more challenging or interesting data sets and apply what you have learned to them. Ensure that the data you select is relevant to your life in some way.</p>
<p>Reflect on what you learned about the data through this process by addressing the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the data you were working with?</li>
<li>What did you learn about this data that you found unique, interesting or surprising?</li>
<li>Was there an ethical dimension that related to the conclusions you have come to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share your thoughts and engage with others in the discussion forum.</p>
