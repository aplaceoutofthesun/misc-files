<h1>Weeks 5 and 6&nbsp;wrap up</h1>
<div>
<p class="note2">You have successfully completed weeks 5 and 6. You are now able to summarise, visualise, and analyse complex data and employ data to build predictive models. You're one step closer to become a data analyst. Well done. And we're looking forward to see you in&nbsp;week 7.</p>
<p>The completion of&nbsp;week 6 means that you have passed the midway point in this unit and you have been introduced to the concepts associated with models and error analysis.</p>
<p>The combination of content&nbsp;and practicals will have given you some of the skills you need to complete problem-solving task three.</p>
<p>In preparation for weeks 7 and 8, trawl the internet for resources on linear programming, which is part of what is starting to be called &lsquo;predictive analytics&rsquo;. Instead of fitting data to models, we come up with the model and utilise those models to make decisions for us.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You will be using more and more advanced applications of data modelling and it is important that you are confident with the foundations before moving on.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>To help you consolidate your learning this week, reflect on the information that was new to you. Spend some time revising the last two weeks content. Practise the programming functions that were introduced to you.</p>
<p>It will also be valuable to use the prescribed textbook <a href="https://link-springer-com.ezproxy-f.deakin.edu.au/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46762-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Introduction to Data Analysis using Aggregation Functions in R</a>&nbsp;(James 2016) to help support your learning and review content delivered during these weeks.</p>
<p>In your reading did you find any chapters or sections of chapters that were particularly relevant to weeks 5 and 6? If so, share the page ranges with your peers and explain how this content was valuable to your learning in the discussion forum.</p>
