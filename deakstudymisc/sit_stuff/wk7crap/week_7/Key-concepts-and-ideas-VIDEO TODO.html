<h1>Key concepts and ideas</h1>
<p class="note3">Welcome to week 7. Over the next two weeks, you'll learn about linear programming and how to apply it for decision making. Our first step is to learn about linear programming models of two variables. How to construct such models, describe them with appropriate mathematical expresssions, and solve the models with the graphical method. Next, we'll move to cases where two variables are not sufficient. You'll learn to build linear programming models of more than two variables, and solve them with R and R-Studio. Happy learning !</p>

<p>Learn about linear programming and how to apply it for decision making.</p>
<p>This week, you will be introduced to Linear Programming models with two variables. You will learn how to describe them with appropriate mathematical expression and solve problems using the Graphical Method.</p>
<p>However, in some cases you may need to use more than two variables. In these cases, you will solve linear programming models with R and RStudio.</p>
<p>Linear programming is usually the first topic taught in operations research, where further study in the area looks at much more complicated models.</p>
<h2 id="casual-online-support">Casual online and face-to-face support</h2>
<p class="note3">Don't forget, in addition to the regular classes and workshops Deakin is providing both online and face-to-face, real-time, drop-in support sessions for all Cloud and&nbsp; Campus students to provide help with linear algebra, R, Python and general maths for&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;units.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>Some other buzzwords in the field of operations research are:</p>
<ul>
<li>non - linear programming</li>
<li>mixed integer programming</li>
<li>quadratic programming</li>
<li>stochastic modelling</li>
<li>convex optimisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have a look at each of them and learn how they differ to linear programming.</p>
<p>Let us know any additional buzzwords that pop out to you and if possible, give a brief explanation in the discussion forum</p>
