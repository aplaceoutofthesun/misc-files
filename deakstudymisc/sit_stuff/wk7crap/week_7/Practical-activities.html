<h1>Practical activities</h1>
<div>
<p>The practical activities are aimed towards building confidence with specific programming sequences in R.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;week 7 and 8 you will be working on more complex programming functions through the practical exercises. These activities will feed into the completion of the problem solving assessment items.</p>
<h3 id="course-4-practical-activities">Week 7 and 8&nbsp;practical activities</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;Practical activities (go to <span style="color: #085394;">Resources&gt;Workshops/Practicals</span>)&nbsp;&nbsp;provide opportunity to apply what has been covered in the learning materials.</p>
<p>Remember, the tasks have been designed to be tackled independently after the theoretical content is covered.</p>
<p>The practical content contains descriptions of scenarios that are similar to the problems presented in weeks 7 and 8. The intention is for you to adapt the existing models as needed to these practical problems.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with some simple examples similar to the Toy Company problem, then methodically move into the harder models.</p>
<h4 id="have-you-worked-ahead">Have you worked ahead?</h4>
<p>Depending on how familiar you are with the R environment, you may have worked ahead.</p>
<p>It might be worth revisiting these pracs. once you have engaged with the learning materials for&nbsp;weeks 7 and 8 to ensure that you understood these materials correctly.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>Practical activities and related online seminars are a valuable addition to the content presented in the learning materials. They allow you to reframe and revisit the material from several directions so that you develop a thorough understanding of the concepts.</p>
<p>Complete the relevant practical activities and related discussions to ensure maximum benefit for your learning.</p>
<p>Share your thoughts in the discussion forum.</p>
