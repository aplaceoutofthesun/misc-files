<h1>Key concepts and ideas</h1>
<div>
<p>The next two weeks&nbsp;will address the question, why do we need to transform data?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Principally, data transformations and data visualisation. Both are fundamental ideas that you will need to have a solid conceptual understanding of in order to progress in this unit.</p>
<p>When working with real data, you will often find that for one variable values may be too large and for another variable too small. But what happens if you need to compare these two variables using the same scale? You need to transform the data so they can be compared on the same scale with the same measure. Often, we present data on the scale from 0 to 1 for convenience. We also need to visualise the data and see how they are distributed.</p>
<p>We use different plots, such as scatter plots or histograms or other ways to visually represent data. So in weeks 3 and 4, you will be learning about different data transformations, normalisation, and operations you need to perform to achieve these transformations.</p>
<p>In addition to your theoretical inquiries, you will be practically investigating these concepts through the use of the programming language R within R studio.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the content covered over the next two weeks will be fundamental to your completion of the first two problem solving assessment tasks and the second quiz.</p>
<h2 id="casual-online-support">Casual online and face-to-face support</h2>
<p class="note3">In addition to the regular classes and workshops Deakin is providing both online and face-to-face, real-time, drop-in support sessions for all Cloud and&nbsp; Campus students to provide help with linear algebra, R, Python and general maths for&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;units.<br /><br /><strong>Online support opening hours</strong><br /><br />Go to the <span style="color: #085394;">Resources&gt;IT Help Hub</span>&nbsp;tab to the left to check the opening hours and access the Bb Collaborate Ultra link to online support sessions&nbsp;and location and times for&nbsp;face-to-face help with a tutor at the Burwood campus.</p>
<h2 id="casual-online-support">Activity</h2>
<p>It is good academic practice to reflect on what you already know about data distribution and transformation before engaging with the content in weeks 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What existing knowledge do you have?</li>
<li>What more would you like to know?</li>
<li>What real life applications of these concepts are you aware of?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share your thoughts and engage with others in the discussion forum.</p>
