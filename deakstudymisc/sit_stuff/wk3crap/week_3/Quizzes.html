<p class="transcript__para">MAIA ANGELOVA TURKEDJIEVA: Welcome to the quiz section. Each course presents you with knowledge and ideas that will be tested with a series of five quizzes. The duration of each quiz will be specified in the quiz description. It is most important to ensure you are familiar with the course content and have [? read ?] [? broadly, ?] as you will have a firm deadline to complete the quiz with only one single attempt available to you. We have provided you with a practise quiz each week to help you with your preparation. The practise quizzes will be open all the time, and you can do as many attempts as you wish.</p>
<p class="transcript__para">For the online quiz, you can use calculators, R programming, or any other programming. But remember, the quiz is individual, and you need to do it within the prescribed time, so you will need to have all your technology ready. Do not leave the submission of this task for the last moment. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have reliable internet connections and facilities to complete the quiz successfully. Remember, you will only have one attempt at each quiz, so be sure to use the practise quizzes to boost your confidence and feel prepared. Good luck.</p>
