<h1>Key concepts and ideas</h1>
<p class="note3">You have successfully completed the first four weeks and are ready to proceed to data summarisation, aggregation, and modelling with R. We will be using some generalisations of the aggregation functions you have studied to be able to do more with the data. You will be using some fuzzy functions to capture the interactions and associations between different variables in the data. Then you will use real data sets to make predictions based on the models you have built. You will be using all of these and more to complete your second assignment. Enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Weeks 5 and 6&nbsp;will take you through a data analysis process, combining knowledge from&nbsp;weeks 1&ndash;4 to allow us to model data and make estimations. You will use real data sets, to make predictions based on the models you have built.</p>
<p>For clarity, when the term &lsquo;model&rsquo; is used in weeks 4 and 5, we&rsquo;re referring to certain types of mathematical equation or structure. But, it can be can be seen abstractly. An example of this that you can think about in a similar sense is when architects build miniature models of buildings as an approximate representation.</p>
<p>Weeks 5 and 6&nbsp;will equip you with the skills you will need to complete Assessment 2: Problem solving task. Please be advised that in the video this is referred to as assessment two.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>Before you begin this&nbsp;week take some time to reflect on what you already know about data modelling and prediction before engaging with the content in weeks 5 and 6.</p>
<p>Reflect upon the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What existing knowledge do you have?</li>
<li>What more would you like to know?</li>
<li>What real life applications of these concepts are you aware of?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share your thoughts and engage with others in the discussion forum.</p>
