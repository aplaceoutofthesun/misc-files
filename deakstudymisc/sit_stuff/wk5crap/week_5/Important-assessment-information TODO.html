<p>At the end of this week you must submit Assessment 2: Problem Solving Task 1.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-2--problem-solving-task-1">Assessment 2: Problem-solving task&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Make sure you are clear on all the submission requirements for assessment 2, prior to the submission of your first problem solving assessment task.</p>
<p><strong>Place:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;submission point&nbsp;for this task can be accessed via the Assessment tab (go to <span style="color: #085394;">Assessment&gt;Assignments</span>).</p>
<p>The video presented by Professor Maia Angelova, gives you more detail about the second of the three problem solving assessment tasks. Ensure you are clear on the expectations for this assessment item. Remember, you will have just three weeks to complete this task so it is best to jump in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;familiarity with the problem solving tasks will ensure that you are focused on related weeks 5 and 6&nbsp;content.&nbsp; To&nbsp;access the full Assessment 2: Problem-solving task brief (<span style="color: #085394;">go to Content&gt;Assessment resources&gt;Assessment 2</span>).</p>

<p class="transcript__para">MAIA ANGELOVA TURKEDJIEVA: This assignment will assess your knowledge and skills to analyse data using aggregation functions in R. We provide for you the data file and the R tool. You will randomly select a specified number of the data following the R command given in the specification. Thus, you will all be working with different datasets. Your first task is to inspect the data and plot them using scatterplots and histograms. Use these plots to make conclusions about the data distributions of different variables. Once this step has been completed, you will select a specified number of variables that you will have the freedom to choose. Apply appropriate transformations to prepare data for analysis with the aggregation functions.</p>
<p class="transcript__para">Use the R package that you will be provided with. And carefully read the descriptions in it. By now, you will know all commands. And all you will need to do is follow the instructions in the package. It will be important to use the appropriate aggregation functions to fit the data and learn the unknown parameters. Select the best-performing model for your prediction. With this selected model, use the learned parameters for four selected variables to predict the variable of interest. Once you have completed these functions in R, wrote a short report to summarise your findings and assess your predictions. Put all your results, plots, and tables in a single PDF file. Upload this file onto the Assessment folder in CloudDeakin.</p>
<p class="transcript__para">Add to this folder an R file with your code and a text file with the transformed data. For this assignment, you need to upload three files only. Do not compress your files. Just upload what is requested in the format requested.</p>
</article>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>Review you assessment prior to submission and focus on the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professionally formatted and easy to read.</li>
<li>Correct calculations.</li>
<li>All files associated with this assessment are ready for submission and clearly labelled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Share your thoughts and respond to others in the discussion forum.</p>
