<h1>Assessments</h1>
<p>There are two different types of assessments: quizzes and problem solving tasks.</p>
<p>Completing the bi-weekly quizzes provides a check point that will give you a sense of how you are progressing in the unit. The problem-solving assessments will require a response to case studies and real world scenarios. This will require higher order thinking.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-task-1-quizzes">Assessment task 1: Quizzes</h3>
<p>Quizzes involve an assortment of multiple-choice and true/false questions that aim to provide quick feedback on your understanding of the material.</p>
<h3 id="assessment-tasks-2-3-and-4-problem-solving-tasks">Assessment tasks 2, 3 and 4:</h3>
<p>Assessment 2 and 3 are&nbsp;problem-solving tasks,&nbsp;Assessment 4 is 2 hours examination.</p>
<p>Problem solving tasks are written assessments with a number of questions that involve applying what you&rsquo;ve learnt to a data set and/or described scenario. They are designed to measure your ability to apply the techniques in this program to scenarios, and to correctly interpret the results. The following outlines will give you a brief introduction to these tasks. However, it is important that you familiarise yourself with the details of all the assignments by viewing the full assignment brief documents.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
