<h5>Introduction to Data</h5>

<h1>Introduction to Data</h1>
<p class="note3">Summarising data is important in order to be able to better understand data properties such as mean, median, and standard deviation. As you progress, you will learn about data aggregation and also different means-- arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means. We will introduce generalisations of these means as well. All of this will be explored using case studies generated from real-life scenarios. We hope that this will enhance your understanding of these new functions and their applications.</p>
</div>
<p>This week we&rsquo;ll extend our R skills to writing functions and working with scripts. This will enable us to work with aggregation functions.</p>
<p>Aggregation functions are an approachable way to tackle various facets of data and to represent certain features of them by a single value. With lots and lots of data about, often times we&rsquo;re looking for ways to better express facets of that data in more accessible ways.</p>
<p>You will need to engage with the ideas and materials through practice and application of the concepts in order to complete the coming problem solving assessment tasks and quizzes. We will introduce you to more complex mathematics and extend your use of R and RStudio.</p>
<p>We will present you with mathematics and programming tasks of increasing levels of complexity. Don&rsquo;t worry, the teaching team have designed the content to support your learning.</p>
<p>For technical issues or other problems go to&nbsp;<a href="https://help.deakin.edu.au/ithelp">https://help.deakin.edu.au/ithelp</a>, the professional team will respond as soon as they can.</p>
<h2 id="your-task">Activity</h2>
<p>Before you move on to this weeks content, it is important that you have already:</p>
<ul>
<li>successful installed R and RStudio and familiarised yourself with both applications</li>
<li>completed the programming tasks presented last week.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be introduced to more complex mathematics this week and it is important to be prepared for this week's tasks and activities.</p>
