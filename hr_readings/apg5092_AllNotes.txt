* Reading 1) Jones, P. "Natural Rights and Human Rights"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Natural Rights vs Human Rights
- Natural Rights
    - 2 Conceptions: 
        - "Strong" sense (Dworkin)
            - basic entitlements of all Humans
            - Govt obligation to ensure these are respected
            - Levellers, Locke, Paine, decl. of rights re Revolutions
            - H.Rights evolved from this conception
        - "Weak" sense (Dworkin)
            - reduced rights to 'liberties'
    - Hobbes's state of nature 
        - shared w e.g. Selden, Diggs, Hammond, Taylor, Spinoza
        - Rights individuals would enjoy in state of nature
        - Individual liberty for self-preservation
            - No "correlative duties upon everyone else"
            - Thus conflict increased
            - Only by "divest"ing rights to common authority => Peace
    - Locke's "natural law"
        - Body of rules governing Human conduct as part of nat order of 
            things
        - Re: God
        - Man subject to God's law in special way (b/c reason)
        - Natural rights:
            - Laws bestow rights and impose duties 
            - Natural laws bestows natural rights and imposes natural duties
            - re: Life, liberty, property 
        - Conflict arose b/c failure to recognise/conform to laws God had
            provided (c.f. a lack of common body of laws)
        - Mankind is the failing c.f. state of nature
        - "executive right of nature" (76)
            - protection of rights by individual
            - surrendered to pol authority => single auth to judge violators
                - c.f. individuals themselves
            - Establishment of pol auth was to better protect rights
    - Upholding of rights: traditionally primary func of govt
        - e.g. American Declaration of Independence 1776
        - e.g. French Declaration of the RIghts of Man and the Citizen 1789
        - Govt only valid if !infringe on rights else legit to overthrow
            - Locke's justification of Glorious Rebellion 1688
    - Social Contract
        - consent of the governed and govern by consent
        - Aquinas: "man a social & pol animal" (77)
            - cooporation nec for "good earthly life"
        - Contractarianism (re: contracts)
            - Filmer, Robert: proponent divine Right of Kings thought it danger
        - Nat rights & Soc contract
            - led to idea of equality (morally)
            - None could claim natural auth over others
            - Pol auth must be est by men themselves and given by those over
                whom it was wielded.
    - Rights claimed as Nat Rights
        - Life: right not to be murdered
        - Liberty: conduct one's life as one chose w/in limits
        - Locke: right to liberty as right to live as he saw fit
            - if he stayed within realm of law of nature
        - French: liberty !injure another
            - freedom of opinion (incl. religious)
            - free communication of thoughts and opinions
        - Authority only with indiv own consent
        - Nat rights theorists: right to resist/unseat oppressors violating
    - Generally, 17-18th C. fundamental rights attr to indiv. essentially 
        negative in char (i.e. 'keep out')
        - right 'from' sthing (c.f. right 'to' sthing)
    - Criticims of idea of Nat rights
        - moral notions passed off as truth or fact
        - Abstract ideas that are not tangible
        - h/e: Context matters re 17-18th C & the cosmology surrounding their 
            conception
    - Rawls (1971): natural duties
    - Rights possessed as H beings regardless of state or members of organisation
    
- Human Rights
    - Clearer than Nat Rights & does not rely on specific cosmological world 
        view entailed by Nat rights
    - Possession of HRights does not depend upon formal recognition (p. 81)
    - Natural in the sense "that people are conceived as possessing those rights
        in their natural capacity as human beings..." (p.81)
        - Not just as citizens
    - Hart (1967): general rights c.f. special; Universal to all humanity
        - special rights: from special transaction/relationship b/n ppl
            - exclusive to those members thereof
    - Being Human suffices
    - Egalitarian idea
        - all possess and have same status
    - HR now legal or semilegal b/c inclusion in international declarations etc
        - Nevertheless, idea of HRs a fundamentally non-legal one
- Content of Human Rights
    - Many conditions and goods claimed as HRs
    - Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Gen Assembly UN in 1948)
        - flawed but useful
    - Types of Rights
        - Right to life
            - may be fundamental (prerequisite for others) 
                - h/e precisedly what right to life is a right _to_ is undefined
            - right not to be murdered or safeguarded from
            - Complications: right to personal security
                - murderer: is right to life retained after act?
                - self defense? Wartime?
        - Rights to libert[y|ies] 
            - Ppl not just free to do what they like
                - violates rights of others
            - right not to be enslaved
            - right to a certain 'area' of personal liberty undefined
            - Often includes freedom of/from:
                - opinion & expression 
                - religion 
                - movement 
                - association 
                - intrusions into one's privacy
        - Right to property
            - unclear how to understand scope and content

                protection of the law
            - Art 11: all charged w criminal offence innocent until prove guilty
        - Political Rights
            - Relate to the workings of political processes
            - Art 21: e/one righ to take part in govt of country
                - directly or via freely chosen representative
        - Socioeconomic Rights
            - Art 22: right to soc sec 
    - Groupings are loose
    - UN doc: important but not "the definitive statement of human rights"
        - produced under difficult circumstances
        - considerable achievement in Int Cooporation
        - still flawed and not a 'touchstone'
        - Discussion of HRs as an idea separate from Declaration
            - Multiple theories of HRs
            - differing reasons for ascribing HRs to Human Beings
        - Significantly longer than 17-18th C. docs
            - e.g. French Decl Rights of Man & Cit (1789): 17 articles
            - UN Decl. Human Rights: 30 articles
        - Other declations/conventions have more
        - Efforts made to improve precision of entailed rights or provide 
            more detail
            - e.g. Eu Convention of Human Rights expands on the right to liberty
    - 20th C greater rights to things not generally claimed as nat rights in 
        earlier periods
        - e.g. Welfare rights
        - Ideas re rights changes over time
        - Nevertheless idea that Humans have rights remains constant
        
- Human Rights and the RIghts of Citizens
    - Nat rights: indiv.s possess in state of nature (i.e. no pol/govt)
    - HRs no longer associated w cosmology of nat law but still conceived as 
        rights Humans enjoy simply in virtue of being human
    - Q: HRs vs Citizen rights
        - i.e. Rights common to all vs Rights by virtue of exclusive membership
        - Melden (1977): indivs that enjoy rights only as members of states 
            cannot be considered truly human rights
        - H/e: Overlap b/n the two
            - e.g. Freedom of [expression | association]
            - Some rights specific to citizenship: Articulation of constraints
                HRs place of govts & state to exercise powers
            - HRs can inform cit rights and ground them
        - Citizen rights as HRs under political conditions
    - Rights made possible by existence of organised pol communities
        - Can look to the idea that Humans have often lived in communities of
            some sort 
    - Rights ascribed to individual citizens can be grounded in the rights 
        ascribed to them as human beings
    
- Scepticism about Human Rights
    - phrase 'Human Rights' does not carry same ontological overtones as 
        'natural rights'
    - Dispute re existence of human rights (intangible, abstract 'thing')
    - Bentham (1962) dismissed nat rights as 'simple nonsense'
    - Alasdair MacIntyre (1985) no such rights & belief in them akin to belief
         in witches and unicorns
     - Consider:
        - "I have a [legal | moral | human] right to x"
        - Categorically different statements
        - legal claim is staetment of fact
            - assertion of institutional fact (cf brute fact)
                - hence it is True or False
        - Does not rely on opinion of whether good or bad thing that ppl should
            have a legal right to x
    - rights claiming moral fouundation subject to all doubts & difficulties that
        characterise any moral position
    - HRs as Moral rights cannot be matters of indisputable truth
    - Criticism only succeeds as casting doubt on idea of moral rights not HRs
    
- Human Rights and Ideal Rights
    - Real rights: rights that people really have
    - Ideal rights: rights that people would ideally have
    - 'is' vs 'ought'
    -

* Week 2: What are Human Rights?

0htoperuseitAllatPerusall_
Introduction

The core goal this week is to familiarise yourself with some basic concepts related to human rights, and to start to grapple with what it means to say that something is a human right. We'll start by exploring the concept of a right - which is a necessary starting point for understanding human rights. We'll also spend some time looking at the relationship between natural rights and human rights (a theme that will continue next week).

The structure of each week will remain constant throughout the semester: there are pre-class activities, which you are expected to have completed prior to the Zoom seminar each Monday; then there are links and resources for use during the Zoom seminar; following the seminar, you should make sure to complete the weekly feedback survey, since this is where you nominate your participation grade for the week - you'll find this in the post-class activities section.

The best place to start with the pre-class activities each week is the mini-lecture. The core readings often take for granted that readers have familiarity with certain concepts or authors, so the mini-lectures provides some necessary background.

Once you've worked through the mini-lecture, it's time to tackle the readings. It's important to make use of the Perusall's annotation features here:

        If there is something in the text you don't understand, highlight it and ask for clarification
        If there is something in the text you disagree with, highlight it and explain why
        If there is something in the text you would like us to discuss as a class in the Zoom seminar, highlight it and explain why.

Once you're confident you understand the reading, you should take the quiz (due each Monday at 10am). The quiz is not timed, and you are welcome to have the readings open while you take it.

Throughout the week, remember to revisit the readings and the discussion forum to continue conversation threads.

                                  * Overview *
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Introduction

This week we'll be focused on a particular story that's often told about human
rights. According to this story human rights originated in western philosophical
 thought, and more precisely in the Enlightenment idea of 'natural rights'. The
 reading by Ishay offers her historical overview of the rise of human rights, 
 while the Locke reading provides an example of one of the key thinkers often
 identified as a precursor to contemporary human rights.

In the pre-class mini lectures I've focused on two distinct but interrelated 
issues, both of which I'd like you to bear in mind when you do the readings. In 
the first lecture, I introduce the concept of 'teleological thinking', as a way 
of interpreting what Ishay is implicitly doing in her chapter (this is followed 
by a short youtube video that I think exemplifies teleological thinking). In the
 second lecture I discuss the prominence Ishay gives to Western history and
 intellectual thought in her explanation of the rise of human rights. These 
 issues are interconnected, because if contemporary human rights are understood 
 as the inevitable end-point of Enlightenment thinking, it becomes harder to
 disentangle them from the sometimes problematic commitments of those thinkers.

(I've also included some optional mini-lectures down in the supplementary 
materials, giving a bit more of an overview of the social contract theories of 
Hobbes and Locke for those who are interested.)

        - Earlier events !effect
    - Take some event in past and use it to explain following events
        - "Great Man"
    - Teleological
        - Events leading up to it are _aiming_ or driving toward event
        - Not accurate
        - Interesting framework for ustanding how Human Rights are told

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Are Human Rights a Western Invention? (20 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* What Does it mean to say that HR are a Western Invention

* 'Human Rights' in what sense?
- Intnl Standards for States (Pol/legal)
    - Complex regime for HRs
    - List of prohibitions for states
- Moral Rights of all Humans
    - Abstracts away from Pol/law
    - Rights ppl have in virtue of being human

* HRs as Int. Standards
- Easier to ustand as independent of Western Intellectual History
- idea of 'overlapping consensus'
    - take a commitment/principle & divorce it from theoretical underpinning
        - agreement on standard but !nec on the reasons behind it
    - e.g. Prohibition of Torture
        - Multiple views
            - Liberalism
            - Religious
    - Focus on getting agreement easier than getting agreement on the underlying
      justification

* HRs as Moral Rights
- Rights merely in virtue of being human
    - re diagram 
    - relationship: entitled & obligated
        - Rights Holder
        - Duty Bearer
- Power of the Rights Holder
    - Can demand the right ("directs" the right)
- Duty Bearer's obligations are _directed_to_ the Rights Holder
- If r/ship idea holds
    - Harder to trace history of HRs
    - Fundamental relationship underpinning earlier traditions is different
    - e.g. Prohibition in Torture
        - Not counted as Right if it does not tie participants in rship of
          entitled and obligated (to)
        - e.g. Religious trad: 
            - Prohibition is directed to Deity
            
* If HRs are moral rights (i.e. r/ship) it is more difficult to create a
  pluralist foundation for them
- More directly connected to certain kind of intellectual tradition            

* Teleology Revisited
- Ishay:
    - Locke & HRs Regime
    - Locke is driving inevitably towards the dev of HRs (Declaration etc)
    - Questionable as to approach
    - Carries additional 'baggage' or ideas that may be better thought of 
      separated out of HRs
        - e.g. HR as Negative rights 
        - e.g. HR as Individualistic 
        - e.g. HR as Implicated in Colonialism
- Locke: 
    - Imperialistic
    - More baggage

* Introduction *

There are many different ways to understand what human rights are. As a result,
theorists have developed taxonomies for identifying similarities and differences
between various conceptions. Each of these taxonomies focus on different
elements, and so group conceptions of human rights in different ways. This week
we'll be comparing two taxonomies,  considering what issues each helps
illuminate, as well as what they obscure.

================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Marie Dembour, 'What Are Human Rights?'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Conceptions of Human Rights
- Differing ideas
    - lack of agreement about what they are
    - Proposal: 4 schools (ideal types) around 2 axes
        - cover whole conceptual field of HRs
    - NB: Term 'Schools' is used to connote implicit/explicit adherence to a 
      number of precepts
        - more used for convenience
- 4 'schools' of thought:
    - "natural scholars": human rights as _given_
    - "deliberative scholars": human rights as _agreed upon_
    - "protest scholars": human rights as _fought for_
    - "discourse scholars": human rights as _talked about_

* Summary of Schools
- Natural School
    - most common idea of HR: rights one possesses simply by being human
    - HRs as _given_
    - HRs entitlements that are *negative* in character, thus absolute
        - i.e. obligation to refrain from something
    - Nature: stands for God, Universe, reason, etc.
    - HRs exist independently of social recognition (h/e recog is preferable)
    - Welcome inscription of HRs in positive law
    - traditionally represented the heart of the human rights orthodoxy
- Deliberative
    - HRs as pol values that liberal societies choose to adopt
    - Tend to reject natural element
    - Existence arises from & via societal agreement
    - Like to see universality but recognise req time
        - Also it reqs global recognition that HRs are best possible legal/pol
            standards that can rule soc & thus be adopted
    - Stresses the limits of HRs
        - regarded as fit to govern exclusively the polity 
        - not relevant to whole of moral/soc human life
    - Constitutional law: one of prime was to express HR values agreed upon
- Protest 
    - Concern: redressing injustice
    - HR articulate rightful claims made by/on behalf of poor, unprivileged, and
      oppressed.
    - HRs as claims and aspitations that allow status quo to be contested in fav
        of oppressed.
    - Not focussed on HRs as entitlements
    - relentless fighting for hRs
    - Accept idea that ultimate source of HRs is 'transcendental plane'
        - h/e more concerned with concrete source of HRs in soc struggles
    - Suspicious of HRs law
        - view HR law as participating in a routinization proc favoring elite
- Discourse 
    - Lack of reverence towards HRs
    - HRs exist bc they are talked about
    - Not given nor the right answer to ills of the world
    - Language surrounding HRs has become powerful with which to express 
        political claims
    - Fear imperialism of HRs imposition
    - Stress limitations of an ethic based on individualistic HRs
    - Some accept HRs discourse can yield positive results
    - H/e: Do not _believe_ in HRs
        - Wish for superior projects of emancipation could be imagined & 
          implemented
          
* Mapping the Field
- Schools are more like Weberian ideal types c.f. fixed categories
- Model
    - !nec map to reality
    - Disagreements within the schools
    - h/e model can help to ID the connections among broad orientations
    - permits mapping of the entire HRs field
    - Constructed _abductively_
        - i.e. arose out of the data and readings
    - Heuristic value over time must be confirmed via persistence in its abilty
        to assoc any HR thinker w a particular school

* The Position of the Schools
- On Human Rights Law
    - Nat Scholars: 
        - celebrate HR law
        - embodies HR concept: law exists continuing w transcendental existence
          of human rights
    - Deliberative Scholars
        - efforts geared toward IDing, agreeing, entrenching principles allowing
          for democratic decision and fair adjudication
            - No HRs beyond HR law
            - Procedural in nature:  guide on how to do things
    - Protest Scholars
        - hard to convince conditions of effective HRs protections realized
        - Always need to further redress injustice
        - Distrust HRs law b/c fear of hijack by elites
        - wary of bureaucratization
        - Do not trust institutions
    - Discourse Scholars
        - HRs law as good/bad as any other law
        - relativistic

- On the Foundation of Human Rights
    - Nat Scholars
        - HR founded in nature
        - aware of issues around it (re: God or whatever)
        - Generally follow legal consensus
            - h/e legal consensus can only be _proof_ of existence of HRs
                - Not foundation
            - Some disagree
    - Protest Scholars
        - Cannot adopt Nat Schol re following legal consensus b/c suspect HR law
        - rely on "tradition"
        - Guy Haarscher: "dressage"
            - training of animals
            - thus internalisation by individual of a logic that is not entirely
              instinctive
        - Tradition base explains interest in education of HRs
    - Discourse and Deliberative scholars
        - Not interested in foundation of HRs
        - more interested in justification c.f. foundation

- On the Realisation of Human Rights
     - 





















--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Charles Beitz, 'What Human Rights Mean'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- UN Decl. HRs: 1948
    - Framers found it easier to agree on content c.f. underlying principles
    - Philosophical args difficult
    - Doc does not propose justifying theory
        - Merely declares things to be true
    - Practical focus
- Issues with ambiguity and generality
- Maurice Cranston "Are there any Human Rights?"
    - Decl. HR: Philosophically fraudulent
    - Negative rights
-

* Introduction

This week we're going to take a break from theory (and from reading!) to fill in some necessary background on the mechanics of human rights practice. We'll focus on the United Nations, and the treaty system that constitutes the bulk of international human rights law.

This week will also be structured a bit differently to other weeks. There will be one short video lecture, giving a brief overview of the international human rights system. However, since there are no core readings, there is no quiz. Also, there are no Perusall annotations, so there won't be the possibility to participate on that platform.

Instead, I'm going to ask you to undertake some collaborative research into a particular treaty or covenant.

I've created Google Docs for five treaties: the Refugee Convention; The Convention Against Torture; the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.

Please allocate yourself to one of these treaties (there's space at the top of the Google Doc to do this - please choose another treaty if the spaces are all already taken).

Then you should independently research some aspect of that treaty, and its role in global politics. This might involve looking at the history of its ratification; or the scope and extent of reservations states have made to it; or the treaty body authorised to monitor compliance; or the enforcement mechanisms that accompany it; or so on. Share your findings on the Google Doc, and then we'll use these as the basis for our discussion in Monday's Zoom seminar.

This week's Zoom seminar will be focused on the research you've done on the
five  treaties. We'll start by going into breakout rooms according to the treaty
you selected, where as a group you'll have 15 minutes to share what you've
learned, and fill in any final gaps in your research. You'll then be asked to
present a short (5 minute) overview of the treaty to the rest of the class. The
remainder of the class time will be devoted to open discussion on the human
rights treaty system.

* Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week we'll be looking at some critiques of human rights practice. The 
chapter from Clifford Bob provides the framework for this discussion: Bob argues
that rights are not inherently progressive, but are better thought of as a
strategic tool that gets used for political ends - whether those ends are good
or bad. The article by Nakissa supplements this analysis, by showing how human 
rights can be used for imperialistic ends, reinforcing hierarchies between the 
'West' and the Islamic world.

Since the Nakissa article is much more theoretically complex, and requires a bit
more background, I've focused the pre-class videos there. You'll find additional
videos on Bob in the supplementary materials for this week.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Mini Lectures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Intro to Bob (10 mins)
(Please note: I refer in this video to other videos on Bob - I decided after
recording that these should be optional rather than required, so you'll find 
them in the supplementary materials section if you're interested.)

* Contextualises Bob's book
- Fits in Bembour's Schools Discourse School
- Analysing way different people use Rights/Push for rights to be realised
    - Attributes to them 'protest school' of thought
    - Thses ppl use language of Natural School ("Natural rights")
- Bob: Discourse
    - Things of rights discourse as an effective political tool to achieve end
        - Words to get what is wanted
    - Does not nec have deeper reality
    - Not just HRs:
        - Includes human rights but interested in all kinds of rights
    - H/e: Uses concept of rights:
        - rights as claims/entitlement -> duties
        - The r/ship idea
* Rights as Weapons
- Goal of book: studuy way rights talk gets used
    - by whom? to what ends? why is it effective?
- Key points: Rights talk used by both sides
    - Does not attribute moral sides (No good vs bad)
    - Notes that both sides invoke language of rights
    - Can be used to oppress as much as protest
- 4 Key metaphors
    - Rallying cries; Shields; Spears; Blockades
    
* Extra video if nec

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Background to Nakissa - Bourdieu's Distinction Strategy (20 mins)

* Intro to Pierre Bourdieu
- Anthropologist
- Book "Distinction"
- Ppt from Harvard: NB: applies theory to different area
- Kinds of Capital (links/rships between)
    - Economic: Financial, etc
    - Social: Networking
    - Cultural: Knowledge, demonstration of taste, judgment
- Capitals are interlinked and reciprocal
- 'Distinction'
    - Idea of cultural capital and taste
    - Idea that Bourdieu was challenging charisma as a 'gift of nature'
        - Argues that upbringing and education influences
        - Interplay b/n social and cultural capital
    - Hierarchy of taste
- Room Rater example
- Distinctions between e.g. TV shows, books, music, food, etc.
- B: One of the key ways that cultural capital maintains status
    - What counts as high class is always changing
    - Nakissa builds on this idea
- Distinction Strategies
    - e.g. Avo smash w latte -> luna croissants -> sourdough starter
- What counts as cultural capital is constantly changing

* From Bourdieu to Nakissa
- What B describes in terms of Aesthetic judgements
    - can be described in terms of Moral judgements
    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Introduction to Nakissa (15 mins)

* How Nakissa uses Bourdieu in HRs
- As cultural capital changes, so does focus of HRs shifts over time
- e.g. Religious freedom -> Increasing attention on Women's rights (-> burqa
    ban) -> LGBT rights
- Elites come to view certain things as important and frame them as HRs
- From B to N:
    - From Aesthetics to Moral judgements
    - From informal norms to laws
- Not a progression, arbitrary changes
- Whenever a new right is brought out
    - reshapes earlier content of HRs

* Values Subversion
- Lib regimes create subjects who idealise subversion
    - e.g. movies depict iconoclaust or freethinker
    - Taken to be a natural expression of Human freedom
    - H/e: N believes it is a culturally shaped preference
        - Connects back to edward saed
            - East vs West: Stagnation vs Progression
    - Inculcation of subversive elements

* From Distinction Strategy to War
- Evolving norms/stds in HRs not only create Hierarchy but also 
    - perpetuates war against Muslim nations
- Interpretations of rights shaped by perceptions
- Reshaping rights -> reshaping duties
- Can see shifting in content of rights occur b/c they generate kinds of duties
    that justify going to war.
- NB: N does not believe it is deliberate manipulation but is an effect of the
    desire to maintain status quo

================================================================================

* Introduction

This week we'll shift to a more international relations focus, looking at the 
relationship between human rights and state sovereignty. For many theorists, 
human rights are seen as part of a broader process of eroding state sovereignty 
in the post WWII world. More specifically, human rights are commonly understood 
to place limits on state sovereignty because they specify rules all states must 
follow, and also because - as we saw with Beitz - their violation is widely 
considered to justify the international community intervening in the domestic 
affairs of the state.

The two readings we'll be focused on this week complicate this simple story of 
human rights eroding state sovereignty. Henkin points to the continuing 
importance of sovereignty, even in an age of globalisation, and to the 
difficulties this raises for the human rights movement; Lafont, by contrast, 
considers how human rights can be used to strengthen state sovereignty, by 
providing a mechanism for states to resist demands made by International 
Organisations (e.g. the WTO), and large corporations.

                               * Introduction *
================================================================================

This week we'll stick with the international relations focus of last week, but
turning now to consider why sovereign states choose to comply with international
human rights law. Given that there are very few effective enforcement mechanisms,
and given that it is often not in states' immediate self-interest to comply with
international human rights law, how often should we expect compliance, and what
explains that compliance?

Our core reading for this week rejects both realist and neoliberal 
institutionalist explanations of compliance, instead pointing to more complex
domestic factors influencing states behaviour.

[Please note: I originally set two core readings for this week, but given the 
long length of the Simmons reading, I have decided to make the second reading, 
by Risse and Ropp, optional (you can find it in the supplementary readings for 
this week). This means all six quiz questions will be on Simmons.]

* Introduction

This week we're focused on the role of NGOs within the contemporary human rights
system. We'll look at how NGOs have helped shape - and enforce - human rights
norms. We'll also consider some criticisms of NGOs, looking particularly at the
claim that they reflect a problematic 'white saviour' mentality.

[Please note I've swapped out one of the core readings that was originally set,
though you can still find it in the supplementary materials section.]

* Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This week we're looking at the first of our three applied topics. We'll learn 
about the history and content of the Refugee Convention; consider the 
limitations of the legal definition of a refugee; and explore moral challenges 
to the existing system of international law concerning refugees.


================================================================================
* Mini Lectures

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Background and Context (10 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Refugee Convention (1951) 
    - 1967 Protocol Addendum
- Definition of a Refugee: Current
    - Only includes what is in the def
    - What is NOT in the convention
        - Other contexts that may be relevant but not covered
        - Climate Refugees
- Relevant Articles
    - Article 32: The right to remain
        - Can't expel refugee excepting nat sec or public order
    - Article 33: The principle of non-refoulement
        - Don't send them back to place of persecution
    - Article 31: No Punishment
        - Can't punish those who come to territory and apply as refugee, even if
          they come illegally
        - NB: Australia is shit at this

* Seeking Asylum
- Everyone who arrives in a state and claims refugee status must be given a fair
  hearing and those found to be refugees must be granted asylum
    - Must be able to arrive to claim
  
- Australia's Response
    - Preventing Access
        - Turning back boats
        - Offshore Detention
        - Exclusion of off-shore territories
        - Regulation of airline carriers
        - etc...
    - Deterring Access
        - Indefinite detention 
        - Refusal to resettle
        
- If asylum seekers do not reach Austrailian territory they cannot claim asylum

================================================================================
* Short Discussion - Beginning of Lecture #2
================================================================================

* NB: Unit is Shifting Disciplines
- From International Theory to Political Philosophy
    - From explanatory framework to moral/political critique
        - From: "why are things the way they are?"
        - To: "Is the way things are justifiable and what whould a just system 
          look like?"
- Strategies of Political Philosophers in argument 
    - Theories as b/ground or framework
    - Often take these theories as 'granted' for expediency
        - Moral Theories 
            - e.g. Consequentialism vs deontology
                - Things are morally good/correct if they lead to good 
                  consequences
                - Versus rules that should be followed and the end does not nec
                  justify the means
        - Political theories
            - Liberalism (individual freedom/equality)
        - Shared Moral/Political commitments (General statements)
            - i.e. "if you agree that...then..."
            - e.g. Slavery is wrong/Holocaust was bad
            
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Introduction to Carens (25 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Joseph Carens
- Starting Assumption (for the purpose of this chapter)
    - States are morally entitled to control who enters
    - Privilege of sovereignty
    - NB: Only used for didactic purposes; Critiques later in the book
- Key Q
    - Do States have a duty to admit refugees?
- Moral Framework
    - States should have admitted Jewish people fleeing Nazi Germany
    
- 3 Ways to justify such a duty
    - 1) Caused responsibility
        - if a state is in some way causally responsible for a person becoming a
          refugee they have a responsibility to fleeing people to grant asylum
        - Iraq Interpreters
    - 2) Humanitarian Considerations
        - Basic moral duty to other human beings
    - 3) The 'Normative Presuppositions of the modern state system'
        - The idea that institutions such as states and norms like sovereignty
            are not inevitable, they are the result of choices made; the system
            is created
        - Many argue sys is justified (seperate sov states)
        - some justify by saying ppl are better overall in this system
        - h/e: Caren suggests that setting up such a system w sov states that 
          control own territory predictibly leads to refugees
            - thus we owe it to them to ameliorate the harms/damage to them
                - Grant refugees asylum
- Clarifying content of the duty
    - Who is a refugee?
        - The inadequacy of the Convention Definition 
            - "Fear of persecution"
    - WHAT must they be given?
        - What does it mean to admit someone
        - what obligations come with this?
        - Admission to a territory is insufficient
            - From admission to membership
            - The act of admission creates additional duties
    - HOW should the duty be allocated?
        - WHich states should admit which refugees?
        - Multiple considerations

- Closing Considerations
    - Need to distinguish b/n two Qs
        - Should states have the authority to determine entry?
        - Is their exercise of that authority criticisable?
        - Should keep these questions distinct and separate
    - Morality and Self-interest
        - Carens: Pessimistic of the idea of reform of refugee system
            - Good moral reasons to change
                - But moral reasons do not overlap with self-interest reasons
                    - i.e. Can't appeal to self-interest to override morals


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Introduction to Kukathas (12 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Are Refugees Special?

* Starting Point
- Common Assumptions
    - Modern state system is basically just, at least in theory
    - States entitled to decide who enters
        - similar to Caren: Moral authority to decide who enters
    - It is just in so far as they have a duty to accept refugees
- Kukathas Challenges the 'justness' of the assumption 

* Posing the Challenge
- 1) There is no morally justifiable way to differentiate refugees from other 
     kinds of immigrants
- 2) When we create institutions to allow entry to refugees they undermine the
     interests of the refugees
    - If we have this common assumptions institutions must be created
        - determine genuine from not refugees
    - These institutions undermine the interests of the people they are meant to
        be protecting

- The moral Challenge 
    - How could we justify treating refugees as special?
        - B/c their lives are at risk
            - h/e Kuk notes issues
                - that risk !nec correlate w persecution
                - Economic migrants may be suffering more
    - The desire to differentiate b/n refugees and migrants suggests a morally
      relevant difference in the reasons that ppl leave their countries
        - Kuk. argues no way to make sense of this
- The Institutional Challenge
    - Institutions, even if working with imperfect definition, are needed
        - e.g. a working definition of refugee
            - h/e how to ensure most needy are helped?
    - Purpose of the institutions is to keep non-refugees out
        - Else they would not be needed
        - Filter out non-genuine refugees
    - Given their purpose, they make it hard to claim asylum
    - Force refugees to prove themselves
        - The onus is on a refugee to prove they meet the standard
    - There are predictable consequences of the state system
        - These institutions will be designed to put the burden on refugees and
            err on the side of keeping ppl out
* The Solution
- No morally justifiable way to distinguish b/n migrants/refugees
- No real way to create institutions that will look after refugees
- Thus
    - Open borders
        - Remove state system
        - Challenging and difficult prospect
    - In the meantime
        - Alter institutions to make the best of what we've got
        - H/e don't pretend the system is justifiable

* Introduction

This week we'll explore the relationship between human rights and global 
inequality. We'll revisit the distinction between negative and positive rights, 
in order to consider what the duties related to freedom from poverty might look
like, and who they may apply to. We'll also consider whether human rights'
commitment to achieving a bare minimum for all, rather than pushing for a more
robust kind of equality, renders them ineffective in challenging global 
inequality.


================================================================================
* Mini Lectures
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction to Week 11 (8 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Q: How we should think about HRs on one hand and Equality on the other
* 2 Readings dealing with this from diff directions
- Shue: Socioeconomic rights
    - basic subsistence
    - a right not widely accepted at time of writing
    - worry that rights->duties
        - req. s/one else to provide duties
    - if there is such a right, whose responsibility is it to provide duties?
    - Is it justifiable?
    - Oneill, Kahn, collins explore this as well
- Moyn: Alternative direction
    - Socioeconomic rights are insufficient
    - Worry: HRs have failed b/c aimed too low
        - Base lvl of subsistence as goal has encouraged/enabled global 
          inequality
    - Q: Are HRs up to challenge of properly addressing problems or just mopping
      up
      
* Empirical Context
- Pop living in extreme poverty has decreased over past few decades
    - Global downward trend
- Advocate of HR could argue this is good achievement
- H/e: Sobering statistic
    - Distribution of Global Wealth (the "1%")
    - Just under 1% command ~= 45% of worlds wealth
        - c.f. 64% command <2% of world wealth
    - Gap b/n rich and poor has accelerated significantly


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Introduction to Shue (28mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Negative and Positive Rights
- Relationship b/n rights holder and duty bearer
- Neg: Reqs duty bearer NOT to do something
- Pos: Reqs duty bearer TO provide something

* Complicating the Picture
- Division bn Neg/Pos rights popular until Henry Shue
- 1980: "Basic Rights" book
    - Context: Responding to the US assumption that subsistence rights are less
      important than political/civil rights
    - Dominant Idea in US 
    - Assumption appeals to the fact that subsistence rights are positive rights
        - i.e. obligation to provide something
        - It is worse to actively harm someone than it is to fail to assist them
        - It's easier to satisfy Negative rights (more realistic)
    - Positive rights are hard and complicated and requires active participation
      and institutions

* Key Claims
- THe right to subsistence is one of the most important human rights
- The right to subsistence is not best understood as a positive right
- The right to subsistence is no harder to satisfy to 'negative' rights such as
  freedom from assault

* Beyond Negative and Positive Rights
- Reconsidering the right to freedom from assault
    - reqs "demand to be protected against harm"
    - demand for positive action
    - Reqs an obligation/entitlement to a system to protect you
- Complicating Neg/Pos rights

* A Case Study: The Right to Subsistence - A Different Perspective
- No relevant diff b/n right to freedom from assault and freedom to susbsitence
- Example:
    - Small Community of subsistence farmers
    - Mostly impoverished
    - No means of generating wealth/income outside of farming
    - slightly uneven distribution 
        - e.g. Head of village: grows most, comfortable
        - e.g. some have less, only just getting by
    - What to do?
        - Poorer villages work for chief, Chief pays them (food/$$$)
        - Stable system
    - Multinat coorporation arrives
        - Makes deal with chief for access to land, etc
        - Chnage from growing beans to e.g. flowers
    - Now farmers that can't get/work enough
        - No way of earning extra money or access to basic sustenance needs
        - Chief does not need them
        - Cannot survive or struggle to do so...
    - Not a radically unusual situation
- "Rights to physical subsistence often can be completely satisfied withouth the
   provision by others of any commodities to those whose rights are in question.
   All that is sometimes necessary is to protect the persons whose sunsistence
   is threateend from the individuals and institiutions that will otherwise 
   intentionally harm them" (Shue, p.40)
    - Can satisfy right to subsistence w/o having to give any aid
    - Why did they suddenly lack ability to survive?
        - Someone did something (Chief/Multinational)
    - Can we begrudge the farmers from wanting more money?
- "The design, building and maintenance of institutions and practices that 
   protect people's subsistence against the callous - and even  the merely 
   over-energetic - is no more and no less positive than the conception and 
   execution of programs to control violent crimes aagainst the person" 
   (Shue, p.45)
   - Need to create infrastructure to disincentivize the situation

* Rethinking Duties - Shue's Proposal
- Every Human Right involves the following three kinds of duty:
    1) duties to _avoid_ depriving (e.g. assaulting, removing livelihood)
    2) duties to _protect_ others from deprivation
        i/  enforcing duty 1 (criminalising assault; outlaw predatory commoerce)
        ii/ design institutions that disincentivize violations of duty 1 (police 
            presence; tack schemes)
    3) duties to _aid_ the deprived

* Shue - A closer Look
- "The central core of the right is a right that others not act in certain ways.
  But the mere core of the right indicates little about the social institutions 
  needed to secure it, and the core of the right does not contain its whole 
  structure" (Shue, p.39)
- Complicates the idea of Neg/Pos rights
    - A 'layered' approach to rights




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Background to Moyn (19mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Egalitarianism

* Sufficiency vs Equality
- Differentiating between
- Sufficiency
    - Identifying a threshold below which no one should fall
    - Recognising that it is improper
- Equality
    - Concerned about the gap b/n the best off and worst off

* Equality of What?
- What is this good that we need to be concerned about?
    - e.g. Goods
        - Money, wealth
    - e.g. respect or status
        - Social Hierarchies
        - How some can move through the world easier than others
    - e.g. Opportunity
        - Not about how much money ppl have now
        - Concerned with ppl having the same opportunity to gain e.g. wealth
- Not necessarily distinct categories
- Moyn
    - Combating Equality of Wealth
    - Material equality
    
* Why Equality?
- Equality as intrinsic good
    - good for its own sake
        - less common for material good
- Equality as instrumental good
    - Good because it secures/protects some other goal
    - Massive inequality undermines Democratic ideals, etc.

* What Kind of Equality?
- Different kind of ideas that can fall under egalitarianism
- 3 different things
    - Strict Equality
        - E/one gets the same (e.g. e/one has same amount of wealth)
        - Criticism: can be viewed as potentially authoritarian 
    - Prioritarianism
        - Distribute towards the worst off
        - Unlike sufficiency, no threshold
        - Prioritise redistribution towards worst off
        - Rawls' theory of justice
            - Argues: take as default that the could should be strict equality
            - Only way to justify deviating is if things are unequal(?)
    - Limits on Inequality
        - Focus on the gap b/n richest and poorest
        - Limit on how wide this should be

* Moyn
- Unclear how clear he is to advocating strict equality
- Not a prioritarianist
- HRs have become captive to Sufficiency and are failing to have impact on 
  inequality

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Introduction to Moyn (16 mins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Socialism vs Human Rights
- Human Rights
    - protect basic rights
    - status equality
        - e/one irrespective of id has the same rights
- Socialism
    - pursue economic justice
- Consider these two ideas as complementary
- Reconciliation b/n Socialism and Human Rights

* HR and Economic Rights
- Socioeconomic rights
- Equality vs Sufficiency and the tension between
- Moyn
    - HRs are commited to sufficiency and only sufficiency
    - Not the kind of material equality the socialist ideal demands
- Historical trajectories
    - Global commitment to Equality decreased
    - Global commitment to Sufficiency increased
- The role of HRs advocates in this

* Sufficiency vs Equality
- Is there really a tension b/n these?
- Ideas/thinking around this
    - 1) Can pursue sufficiency, then equality
        - Moyn implicitly suggests this
    - 2) Sufficiency requires inequality
        - Concern w e/one getting above threshold req some inequality
        - to raise ppl out of poverty, must generate material goods
        - in doing so will sacrifice equality, by using ideas that tend to 
          increase inequality
    - 3) Sufficiency requires Equality
        - If we want to achieve sufficiency, then must establish some lvl of 
          equality
        - or at least reduce inequality
        - Gross inequality decreases support for social safety net

* Human Rights vs Equality
- Why has Sufficiency come to dominate?
- Differing views
    - Liberal individualism & tension b/n
        - neoliberal market fundamentalism
            - rejects human rights
        - vice versa
- Moyn's view
    - Not necessarily tied
    - Missed opportunity
    - Welfare state could have led to Equality
    - Over time, HRs movement chose to distance self from this
    - Human rights began focusing on Sufficiency

* Closing Thoughts
- Where to from here?
- Moyn
    - Need to reinfuse HRs towards greater commitment to equality
- Are Human Rights conceptually compatible with material equality?
    - Potentially not:
        - Built into def of HR
        - Morality of the depth
        - set a sufficient minimum
    - Change definition or how we think about it?
    - if yes:
        - reshape human rights
    - if no:
        - supplement rights w another ideal
    - pros/cons of both approaches
        - Something to think about it?

* Introduction

We'll close out the semester by considering the role of human rights in a time 
of climate emergency. Can human rights provide an effective framework for 
preventing climate change, or does their inherent anthropocentrism render them
 inadequate to the task?
